Task 1:
// Under this line write a message to yourself from GitHub
This is my first message.
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
The git fetch command fetches changes in the remote repo compared to your local repo.

Task 2:

// Under this line describe why we need to run 'git push' after making a commit
Commits are super important, as one should commit often and commit early. Since commits aren't automatically pushed to the repo in the command line, it allows programmers to push a batch of commits at one time.the command git push will push all local commits to the remote repo.

Task 3:

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-A'

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-B'

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-C'

// END OF LAB 4
